You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)

Example 2:
coins = [2], amount = 3
return -1.

The code below is perfect. Save for study
class Solution(object):
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        """
        :type coins: List[int]
        :type amount: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        #python dp solution
        MAX = float('inf')
        dp = [0] + [MAX] * amount

        for i in xrange(1, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min([dp[i - c] if i - c >= 0 else MAX for c in coins]) + 1

        return [dp[amount], -1][dp[amount] == MAX]
